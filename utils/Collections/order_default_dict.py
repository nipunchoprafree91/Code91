ordered dict and default dict.

class collections.OrderedDict([items])
Return an instance of a dict subclass that has methods
specialized for rearranging dictionary order.

Ordered dictionaries are just like regular dictionaries
but have some extra capabilities relating to ordering
operations. They have become less important now that the
built-in dict class gained the ability to remember insertion
order (this new behavior became guaranteed in Python 3.7).
